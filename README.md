**Full-Stack Developer · STS Researcher**  
Building sovereign identity and heritage infrastructure. Incoming PhD focused on the political economy of decentralized identity.

I work at the intersection of **protocol architecture** and **political theory**, with a particular interest in how technical systems encode power, governance, and legitimacy. My current work bridges Science and Technology Studies (STS) with hands-on Web3 development, with an emphasis on digital sovereignty and long-term institutional design.

## Technical and Research Focus

My work spans both system implementation and critical analysis, with an emphasis on how technical design choices shape power, governance, and long-term institutional behavior.

I work primarily with Rust and TypeScript, building and analyzing protocol-level systems across the Internet Computer and EVM-based environments. My work includes smart contract and protocol architecture, identity and access models, and the translation of complex technical systems into language that can be understood, evaluated, and maintained.

![Commons](https://img.shields.io/badge/Digital%20Commons-355070?style=flat)


My research sits at the intersection of political economy and technical infrastructure. I focus on decentralized identity, governance mechanisms, and commons-based systems, drawing from Science and Technology Studies (STS) to examine how digital systems encode power, legitimacy, and institutional values over time.

## Current Work

### The Heritage Ledger (in progress)
A decentralized infrastructure for cultural heritage and museum stewardship.  
The project explores how decentralized identifiers and cryptographic provenance can support long-term institutional trust, public ownership, and digital sovereignty for cultural artifacts.

### *Building Blocks* — Master’s Thesis  
*A critique of netarchical capitalism and the political economy of blockchain systems.*

A 40,000-word research project examining how decentralized technologies can either reproduce extractive power structures or enable genuinely cooperative digital institutions.  
**Writing sample available upon request.**

## Technical Philosophy

“Code is law” is an incomplete idea.  
In practice, code functions more like a **constitutional draft** — defining who holds power, how decisions are made, and whose interests are protected.

My work is guided by three principles:

1. **Sovereignty**  
   Digital identity should be owned, not rented. Users must be able to exist, transact, and exit without reliance on centralized intermediaries.

2. **Mechanism Design**  
   Protocols are economic and political systems. Their incentive structures determine whether they enable coordination or concentrate power. Design choices are never neutral.

3. **Democratic Ownership**  
   A system is only worth building if it can be meaningfully governed by its users. If participants cannot understand, influence, or leave a system without penalty, it is not decentralized — it is merely automated.

I treat decentralized systems as institutional infrastructure: long-lived structures that shape coordination, trust, and power over time.

Ultimately, my work is aimed at expanding the digital commons — unlocking shared digital value by building systems that preserve collective ownership, democratic participation, and long-term public benefit in an increasingly privatized digital world.
