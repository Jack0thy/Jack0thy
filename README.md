### I'm Jack. 

> **Full-Stack Dev & STS Researcher.**
> Building sovereign identity & heritage infra. Incoming PhD exploring the political economy of decentralized identity.

I operate at the intersection of **protocol architecture** and **political theory**.  Deeply passionate about the emancipatory potential of decentralized identity. Currently bridging the gap between Science & Technology Studies (STS) and Web3 implementation.

### 🛠 The Dual Stack

I approach problems with two toolkits: one for building systems, and one for critiquing them.

### ⚡ Technical Philosophy
*"Code is law"* is a fallacy. Code is a **constitutional draft**. My work focuses on:
1. **Sovereignty**  
   Digital identity should be owned, not rented. Users should be able to exist, transact, and exit without platform dependence or hidden custodianship.
2. **Mechanism Design**  
   Protocols are economic and political systems. Their incentive structures determine whether they serve users or concentrate power. Design choices are never neutral.
3. **Democratic Ownership**  
   A system is only worth building if it is ultimately governed by its users. If people cannot understand it, influence it, or leave it without penalty, then it is not decentralized — it is merely automated.
