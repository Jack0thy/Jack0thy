## Jack Smye

**Full-Stack Developer · STS Researcher**  
Building sovereign identity and heritage infrastructure. Incoming PhD focused on the political economy of decentralized identity.

I work at the intersection of **protocol architecture** and **political theory**, with a particular interest in how technical systems encode power, governance, and legitimacy. My current work bridges Science and Technology Studies (STS) with hands-on Web3 development, with an emphasis on digital sovereignty and long-term institutional design.

## Technical and Research Focus

I approach problems through two complementary lenses: building systems, and interrogating the assumptions embedded within them.

### Technical Work
- Rust, TypeScript, Motoko  
- Internet Computer and EVM-based systems  
- Smart contract and protocol architecture  
- Technical documentation and whitepaper development  
- LaTeX for structured, research-grade writing  

### Research Interests
- Political economy of digital infrastructure  
- Science and Technology Studies (STS)  
- Decentralized identity and governance  
- Commons-based peer production  
- Institutional design in cryptoeconomic systems

## Current Work

### The Heritage Ledger (in progress)
A decentralized infrastructure for cultural heritage and museum stewardship.  
The project explores how decentralized identifiers and cryptographic provenance can support long-term institutional trust, public ownership, and digital sovereignty for cultural artifacts.

### *Building Blocks* — Master’s Thesis  
*A critique of netarchical capitalism and the political economy of blockchain systems.*

A 40,000-word research project examining how decentralized technologies can either reproduce extractive power structures or enable genuinely cooperative digital institutions.

## Technical Philosophy

“Code is law” is an incomplete idea.  
In practice, code functions more like a **constitutional draft** — defining who holds power, how decisions are made, and whose interests are protected.

My work is guided by three principles:

1. **Sovereignty**  
   Digital identity should be owned, not rented. Users must be able to exist, transact, and exit without reliance on opaque intermediaries.

2. **Mechanism Design**  
   Protocols are economic and political systems. Their incentive structures determine whether they enable coordination or concentrate power. Design choices are never neutral.

3. **Democratic Ownership**  
   A system is only worth building if it can be meaningfully governed by its users. If participants cannot understand, influence, or leave a system without penalty, it is not decentralized — it is merely automated.

I treat decentralized systems as institutional infrastructure: long-lived structures that shape coordination, trust, and power over time.

Ultimately, my work is aimed at expanding the digital commons — unlocking shared digital value by building systems that preserve collective ownership, democratic participation, and long-term public benefit in an increasingly privatized digital world.
